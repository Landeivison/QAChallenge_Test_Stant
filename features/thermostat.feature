Feature: Thermostat Controller
    As a user

    Scenario: Turning the Heater On and Off

        Given that the temperature is identified
        When the measured temperature is <temperature>
        Then the heater is <function>

        Examples:
            | <temperature> | <function> |
            | 23째C          | "off"      |
            | 28째C          | "off"      |
            | 4째C           | "on"       |
            | 1째C           | "on"       |
